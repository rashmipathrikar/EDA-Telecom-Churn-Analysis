# EDA Telecom churn Analysis

# Problem Statement:

Finding out the factors and churning the customers that influence them. Retain customers by taking appropriate steps by providing offers based on the influencing factors. Using the data provided, this paper aims to analyze the data to determine which variables are correlated,  with customer churn. An analysis will also be done to identify the people doing the churning.

# Approach:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze data. The first and foremost task is that the data analysis to view the data and tries to make some sense out of it. Later we figure out what question we want to ask and how to use the available data to get the insights and all the answers that we need from the data set. EDA helps us to

# Delve into the dataset

Examine the relationships among the variables

Identify the interesting observation

Develop an initial idea of possible associations among the predictors and the target variable. 

Our telecom data set consists of 20 features and 3333 records. out of which 3 objective, integer, and float both have 8 and 1 Boolean data type.

# Conclusions:

The telecom market is saturated and the subscriber growth rate is low. Hence the main focus of the market players is on retention and churn control. This project explores the churn dataset to identify the key drivers of churn and derive key insights from the dataset. The insights we've gained into churn data through the use of exploratory data analysis:

The four charge fields are linear functions of the minute fields.
The area code field and the state field are anomalous and can be omitted.
The correlation among the remaining predictor variables are weak, allowing us to retail them all for any data mining model.
Customer with the international plan tend to churn more frequently.
Customers with four or more customer service call churn more than four times as often as do the other customers.
Customers with high day minutes and evening minutes tend to churn at a higher rate than do the other customer.

There is no obvious association of churn with the variable day calls, evening calls, night calls, international calls, night minutes, international minutes, account length or voice mail message.
